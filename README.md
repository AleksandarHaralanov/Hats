# Hats
Allows items and blocks to be worn as hats.

<b>Download latest release [here](https://github.com/AleksandarHaralanov/Hats/releases/latest).</b>
- Compiled on Adoptium JDK 8 and [Poseidon](https://github.com/RhysB/Project-Poseidon), fork of CB1060.

## Usage
By default, only OPs have permissions. Use PermissionsEx or similar plugins to grant groups the permission, enabling the command.
- Command: ```/hat```
- Permission: ```hats.wear```

You can disable wearing armor as hats (except helmets) in ```plugins\Hats\config.yml```.
- This is optional, but note that armor worn in the helmet slot grants more protection than usual and therefore, if you care, it is considered a 'cheat'.
