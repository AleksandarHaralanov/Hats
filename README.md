# Hats
Allows items and blocks to be worn as hats.
# Usage
By default, only OPs have permissions. Use PermissionsEx or similar plugins to grant groups the ```hats.wear``` permission, enabling the ```/hat``` command.

You can disable wearing armor as hats (except helmets) in the config.
- This is optional, but note that armor worn in the helmet slot grants more protection than usual and therefore, if you care, it is considered a 'cheat'.
